tm3load
=======

This is a simple driver for [tm3](https://github.com/tingley/tm3) that I
wrote to test data loading and fuzzy lookup.  It includes a very 
quick-and-dirty TMX parser and some stubby data classes.

Dependencies
============

This depends on a couple of maven artifacts that are not currently available
unless you pull them and install them locally:
* [tm3](https://github.com/tingley/tm3)
* [snax-xml](https://github.com/tingley/snax-xml)

All code is released under the Apache 2.0 license.
